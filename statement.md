# Smart Attendance System - Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Traditional attendance systems in educational institutions rely on manual methods such as roll calls, sign-in sheets, or biometric fingerprint scanners. These approaches suffer from several significant limitations:

- **Time-consuming processes** that waste valuable classroom time
- **Proxy attendance** where students mark attendance for absent peers
- **Physical contact requirements** that pose hygiene concerns
- **Human errors** in manual record-keeping and data entry
- **Limited analytics** and reporting capabilities
- **Inefficient tracking** of student attendance patterns

There is a critical need for an automated, accurate, and contactless attendance system that can streamline the process while providing reliable data for academic monitoring.

## Scope of the Project
The Smart Attendance System provides a comprehensive solution for automated attendance management using facial recognition technology.

### In-Scope:
- Student and faculty user registration and management
- Facial data enrollment and encoding
- Real-time attendance marking through face detection
- Role-based dashboards (Student & Faculty)
- Attendance reporting and analytics
- Web-based interface accessible on multiple devices
- Secure authentication and data protection

### Out-of-Scope:
- Integration with existing university ERP systems
- Mobile application development
- Advanced biometric features beyond facial recognition
- Multi-campus deployment architecture
- Advanced predictive analytics for student performance

## Target Users
